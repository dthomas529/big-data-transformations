# big-data-transformations

Project title: Big Data Transformation with PySpark
Link were the app is hosted
Task: A large dataset is transformed using PySpark
Criteria:
Write code
.Convert dataset to distributed cluster dataset
Summary: Using Google CoLab, I wrote Python code to convert dataset, then used PySpark to transform it to distributed data cluster.
Functionality: 
Design: PySpark increases the speed of data processing.
Run locally: User should expected dataset to be ready to analyze
Run this command: git clone https:://…git
Run npm install
Double check your ports …that can usually cause errors
Run npm run start-dev
You are now in the development environment
Tech Stack:
